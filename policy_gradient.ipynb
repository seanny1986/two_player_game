    "# Fun With Two-Player Games\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the following game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have two players;\n",
    "2. Each player draws two numbers at random, and in secret, from a uniform distribution;\n",
    "3. Each player chooses one of their two numbers;\n",
    "4. The players each reveal their number;\n",
    "5. Denoting the larger value as $L$ and the smaller value as $S$, If $L \\geq 3S$ the larger number wins. Otherwise, the smaller number wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question as asked in the above post is: \"given any two numbers, which should one choose?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of solving this problem is using the score function estimator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta) = \\int_{x}\\nabla_{\\theta} \\log p_{\\theta}(x) \\,f(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And using gradient ascent step the weights in the direction that maximizes $f(x)$. To do this, we'll parameterize the weights $\\theta$ of $p_{\\theta}(x)$ with a neural net. The network will take in a set of two values that we'll call the state, and -- since we have a discrete set of choices -- will output scores over those two values using a softmax function. We'll use these scores to create a categorical distribution, and sample from it to choose one of the numbers. Since the numbers are private, the network will only be able to see its own numbers, and not anybody else's.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is often seen in Reinforcement Learning, where it's known as the Policy gradient. Our $f(x)$ in this case will be the function that determines whether or not we win or lose the game given the number that we pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, I'll import the dependencies. Since we're using a neural net, I'll be using PyTorch to do most of the heavy lifting:"

The update function implements the score function estimator above, and torch's autodifferentiation pushes it back through the computation graph. I've written a select_action function as well to handle sampling from the distribution, and getting the log-probability of the action."

Second of all, we need a function to check who won the game once both players have chosen their number. I put a function together to map an action from our policy to a given value just to make the code a bit clearer. Finally, we'll also want to test a trained policy against a random policy to make sure that our trained policy is learning. Ideally, we should always come out ahead of just selecting a number at random."

    "So as we suspected, Alice's win percentage is around 54%, which is comfortably beter than Bob. A cursory look a the batches indicates that Alice kicks the tar out of Bob's random policy, and rarely drops below 50%. In some cases, her win percentage can spike as high as 70%. We can also see the the values that win the most often, and note that the peak occurs somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4. Given any two values, you can figure out by looking at this chart which one you should pick if you want to maximize your odds of winning.\n",

    "### Charlie and Bob Duke It Out\n",
    "Next up, we'll train two policies adversarially. Bob and Charlie have beef with one another -- Bob is freaked out by Charlie's red hair, and Charlie has picked up on this, and lets his dog crap on Bob's front lawn. Rather than fence his property, Bob has agreed on Alice's suggestion to settle his differences with Charlie in a game of skill. Oddly enough, the very game that Alice and Bob use to determine who does the dishes. The stakes are high, because Bob is trying to salvage his failing marriage to Alice, and there's evidence to suggest that Alice may in fact be into redheads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is the same as last time, except now Bob is no longer using a random policy. Instead, both players are attempting to maximize their respective scores in order to beat their opponent. We now have two policies -- one for Bob, and one for Charlie -- both parameterized by neural nets as we did with Alice. The only major difference is that we'll be drawing from and and updating both policies at the same time. The rules of the game haven't changed, so as before, both players only have access to their own two numbers. Since this is serious business, we'll up the number of iterations; Bob and Charlie are now stuck in a best-of-150,000 two player game."

Firstly, because I've run this experiment a few times now, and each time it's converged on Bob beating Charlie. Maybe there's a mistake in the code? I'm not sure. Does it ever end up 50/50, or with Charlie stealing Alice from Bob? Secondly, the distribution of winning values is different for both players. Charlie's is completely different from Bob's, which looks a lot like Alice's.\n",

Alice doesn't try to learn here, she just plays against herself to see how she would fare against an equally skilled opponent:"
